                   Outward facing it's easy, a simple Express server running on NodeJS, an FAQ, and a form
                   rendered with Pug. Your data is being stored on MongoDB. Internally We've setup a Twitter
                   bot that uses Twitter's Streaming and REST api's. It is always listening for certain key
                   words and phrases. Whenever a tweet is sent that matches the criteria, the server intercepts
                   and runs it through an algorithim. If the algorithim determines it is valuable, we send a
                   mass text to all registered numbers using Twilio's SMS/MMS messaging service, containing
                   relevant info from the tweet.
